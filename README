##  Overview
The **Cross-Brain Neural Network (CBNN)** and **Deep Cross-Brain Neural Network (DCBNN)** are biologically inspired deep learning architectures designed to model *inter-hemispheric communication* for improved time-series forecasting.

Key features:
- **Hemispheric specialization:** LSTM (temporal) + CNN (spatial) asymmetric subnetworks  
- **Corpus Callosum Connection (CCC):** Learnable cross-layer projection between hemispheres  
- **Walk-Forward Cross-Validation (WFCV):** Expanding-window evaluation across multiple assets  
- **Comprehensive baselines:** CNN, LSTM, DLinear, TFT, FEDformer, PatchTST  
- **Statistical validation:** Diebold–Mariano tests, confidence intervals, and directional accuracy metrics
